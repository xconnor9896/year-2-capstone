_Planning_

_—_

The free prototyping software Figma was used to create an extensive wireframe of what the site will look like. The site is designed exclusively for desktops and tablets in mind. Two separate wireframes were created by each session, with the final product being a consolidation between the two. The list-making application Trello was used in order to make the significant workload that comes with this project more bearable given the size and scope of this project. In order to facilitate proper communication within the group, the instant messaging application Discord was used in order to share ideas, files, and other important information throughout the course of the development process.

_Development Timeline_

_—_

This timeline will go through the development cycle on a weekly basis.

Week 1



* The first week of development was mainly focused on laying groundwork for the project. This involved things like getting all of the necessary applications ready to go in order to start development and the design process. Initially, session 1 used Adobe Xd to create a rudimentary wireframe of the site, but this was later consolidated into a Figma wireframe where both session 1 and session 2 could collaborate on the design.

Week 2



* The second week of the project was when actual coding began. Once the GitHub repository was set up and each individual working on the project was granted collaborator access, work began. Things like 404 pages, basic HTML, and basic controllers began to take shape during this week.

Week 3



* The third week of the project was when the designs that were created in Figma began to take shape in the actual project. However, there were two different dashboards that were being created during this time due to poor communication between the two sessions. This would cause issues in later weeks, but it did not affect back-end development.

Week 4



* The fourth week of the project was focused on back-end development. Controllers, email verification, and the database began to take shape during this stage. The majority of the controllers were finished minus the email controller as that had to be done in tandem with setup for SendGrid, which did take time due to their high levels of security.

Week 5



* The fifth week of the project was when the two dashboards suddenly became an issue due to poor communication among both groups. 

 

Week 6



* The sixth week of the project involved the two aspects of the project finally starting to come together. The MongoDB was also set up properly so that things like users, reports, and other important information could be stored securely. Access to the database was given out upon request.

Week 7



* More work on hooking up the front and back end was completed during this week. The project is coming to a close so this SDLC began to get updated.

Week 8



* The final week of the project will most likely consist of finishing touches and creating a markdown-friendly version of the SDLC.

_Testing_

_—_

Testing was carried out through normal compilation of code into a web browser by locally hosting the code on a host computer. For calls to the back-end, the application Postman was used to test controllers before they were implemented.

_Delivery_

_—_

 

A tentative due date of May 11, 2022, was set by Mr.Peck. The submission method is to be determined, though it is assumed that it will be through Google Classroom via a GitHub repository link.
